bashcolors3.sh 
I have uploaded this simple Unix (Bash) program that displays in OSX Terminal both the background and text colors for each value 0-255. Searching the web I found the reference material for colors did not seem to match with reality. Colors varying on different platforms it seems.  So I wrote this little program to sequentially display all the colors in fairly compact form. Now I can pick the color I want, and know the number that gives it to me on my particular system. It is a simple utility program.  I find it kinda cool.
