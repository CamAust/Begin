Just setting up. Learning how GitHub works. 
I have uploaded one simple Unix (Bash) program that displays in Terminal background and text colors for each value 0-255. Reference material found re colors seemed to not match with reality. Colors varying on different platforms it seems.  So I wrote this so I could pick the color I wanted, and know the number that gives it on my particular system OSX, Unix Bash. A simple utility program.  I find it kinda cool.
